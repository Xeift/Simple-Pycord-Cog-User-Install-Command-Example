# Simple-Pycord-Cog-User-Install-Command-Example
An example bot of user install slash command + cog. Using Pycord 2.6.1

What can this bot do?
-----------------
1. Use slash command in public server, private server and DM. You don't need to have bot installed in the server to use the command, you can use command everywhere!
2. Using your bot command by App Launcher.

Quickstart
-----------------
1. Download or `git clone` this repository.

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python library.

3. Run `python main.py` to start the bot.

Detailed Guide
-----------------
1. To run this bot, first you need to create a bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). I assume you are already very familiar with this step. If you don't know how to do this, go watch some tutorial videos on YouTube.
2. Since we are making a bot that supports *user install commands*, we need to make some configuration at dev portal, as below image shows.
